In the the previous section, we learned a 'quick approach' to calculate accessibility directly from within `{r5r}`. The shortcoming of this approach it that is limited to only a few predefined accessibility metrics available in `{r5r}`. Oftentimes, we want to analyze other types of accessibility metrics and/or to have more control of the different steps of the analysis.

In this section, we'll learn how to calculate a travel time matrix and how to use it to compute different types of accessibility metrics. This is a more 'flexible' approach that combines the capabilities of the `{r5r}` and the `{accessibility}` packages. We'll use again the sample data for the city of Porto Alegre (Brazil) that comes with the `{r5r}` package.

<!-- package logos side by side  -->
<div style="text-align: center">
<table><tr><td><img src='/images/r5r_logo.png' width="180"></td><td><img src='/images/accessibility_logo.png' width="180"></td></tr></table>
</div>


This flexible  approach to calculate accessibility only involves 3 steps.

1. Building a routable transport network
2. Calculate a travel time matrix
3. Calculate acessibility

Now let's start by loading load the packages we need:




::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# allocating memory to java
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx6G")

library(r5r)
library(accessibility)
library(h3jsr)
library(dplyr)
library(mapview)
library(ggplot2)
```

# 1. Building a routable transport network

First, we build the multimodal transport network by passing the path of our data dirctory to the `r5r::setup_r5()` function.




::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# dir with data
data_path <- system.file("extdata/poa", package = "r5r")

# build network  
r5r_core <- r5r::setup_r5(data_path, 
                          verbose = FALSE)
```

# 2. Calculate a travel time matrix




::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
# routing inputs
mode <- c("walk", "transit")
max_walk_time <- 30      # in minutes
travel_time_cutoff <- 20 # in minutes
time_window <- 30        # in minutes
departure_datetime <- as.POSIXct("13-05-2019 14:00:00",
                                 format = "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S")


# Travel time matrix
# calculate travel time matrix
ttm <- r5r::travel_time_matrix(r5r_core,
                               origins = points,
                               destinations = points,
                               mode = mode,
                               departure_datetime = departure_datetime,
                               max_walk_time = max_walk_time, 
                               max_trip_duration = 60,
                               time_window = time_window,
                               progress = TRUE
