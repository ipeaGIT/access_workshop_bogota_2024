In case you don't, [follow these simple instructions here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).\n\n\n\n# Installing R packages\n\nThe workshop uses a few R packages that need to be installed in your machine. The simplest way to do this is running the code below. This might take a few minutes if this is the first time you install these packages.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npkgs_to_install <- c('r5r',\n                     'accessibility',\n                     'ggplot2',\n                     'mapview',\n                     'dplyr',\n                     'h3jsr',\n                     'sf'\n                     )\n\ninstall.packages(pkgs_to_install)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe safest way to replicate the code of this workshop, though, is cloning its [repository](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/access_workshop_WSTLUR_2024) locally. This is because this repository uses the `{renv}` R package to manage the workshop dependencies, which is important to make sure we are using the intended versions of the packages dependencies.\n\nOnce you have cloned the repo and you've opened the `access_workshop_bogota_2024.Rproj` file, you can simply run `renv::restore()` to install all the package dependencies used in this workshop.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# uncomment the line below in case you need to install the {renv} package\n# install.packages('renv')\nrenv::restore()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Installing Java JDK\n\nTo use the `{r5r}` package (version v2.0 or higher), you will need to have *Java Development Kit (JDK) 21* installed on your computer. There are numerous open-source JDK implementations. The easiest way to install JDK is using the new [{rJavaEnv}](https://github.com/e-kotov/rJavaEnv) package in R, developed by Egor Kotov (thanks Egor!)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install dev version of {rJavaEnv}\nremotes::install_github(\"e-kotov/rJavaEnv\")\n\n# install JDK 21\nrJavaEnv::java_quick_install(version = 21,\n                             distribution = 'Corretto')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can manually download and install any of these options:\n\n- [Adoptium/Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/)\n- [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/)\n- [Oracle OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/21/)\n",
