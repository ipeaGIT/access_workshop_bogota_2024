Ainda hoje, o foco na mobilidade motiva políticas que priorizam a circulação de automóveis e visam aumentar a velocidade e a fluidez de trânsito para reduzir congestionamentos e, consequentemente, tempos de deslocamento [@levine2019mobility]. Essas políticas, no entanto, tendem a dar um enfoque quantitativo na mobilidade: aumentar o número de viagens, aumentar a velocidade média, diminuir o tempo de congestionamento etc.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWSTLUR Workshop\nA crash course on urban accessibility with R\nFrom 2pm to 4pm, on Wednesday, 19 June 2024\n\nSummary:\nRouting and accessibility analyses are increasingly used in urban and transport research and planning. In this workshop, you will learn how to estimate travel time matrices and perform accessibility analyzes in multimodal transport networks using the R programming language. The workshop will also illustrate how to assess the accessibility impacts of transportation projects from a transportation equity perspective. The course is based on the book “Introduction to urban accessibility: a practical guide with R”, available online at https://ipeagit.github.io/intro_access_book/. \n\n\nComputational requirements:\nTo follow the workshop, you should have the following programs installed on your machine. More information here.\n•\tR and RStudio\n•\tJava Development Kit (JDK) 21\n*** These should be installed *before* the workshop\n\nReading material:\n•\tOnline book “Introduction to urban accessibility a practical guide with R” https://ipeagit.github.io/intro_access_book/ (Chapters 3 and 6)\n•\tPaper of the {r5r} package https://doi.org/10.32866/001c.21262 \n•\tWebsite and documentation of the {r5r} package  https://ipeagit.github.io/r5r/ \n•\tWebsite and documentation of the {accessibility} package https://ipeagit.github.io/accessibility/ \n\nInstructor:\nRafael H. M. Pereira\nHead of Data Science\nInstitute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea), Brazil\nPersonal website: https://www.urbandemographics.org/about/\n\nShort bio of the instructor:\nRafael H. M. Pereira is a senior researcher in the fields of urban analytics, spatial data science and transport studies at the Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea), Brazil. His research looks broadly at how urban policies and technologies shape the spatial organization of cities, human mobility as well as their impacts on social and health inequalities. Some of his key contributions to the fields of urban analytics and planning involve the development of new methods and open-source computational tools to the study of urban systems and transportation networks. These contributions emerge from substantive interests around social justice and sustainability issues in urban development, with particular focus on transportation equity and inequalities in access to opportunities, and the environmental impacts of built environments and mobility patterns. With a background in Sociology and Demography, Dr. Pereira obtained his PhD in Geography from the Transport Studies Unit at Oxford University.\n\n",
