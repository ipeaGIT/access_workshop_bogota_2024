If you don't, [follow these simple instructions here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).\n\n\n\n# Installing R packages\n\nThe workshop uses a few R packages that need to be installed in your machine. The simplest way to do this is running the code below. This might take a few minutes if this is the first time you install these packages.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npkgs_to_install <- c('r5r',\n                     'accessibility',\n                     'ggplot2',\n                     'mapview',\n                     'dplyr',\n                     'h3jsr',\n                     'sf'\n                     )\n\ninstall.packages(pkgs_to_install)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe safest way to replicate the code of this workshop, though, is cloning its [repository](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/access_workshop_WSTLUR_2024) locally. This is because this repository uses the `{renv}` R package to manage the workshop dependencies, which is important to make sure we are using the intended versions of the packages dependencies.\n\nOnce you have cloned the repo and you've opened the `access_workshop_bogota_2024.Rproj` file, you can simply run `renv::restore()` to install all the package dependencies of the workshop.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# uncomment the line below in case you need to install the {renv} package\n# install.packages('renv')\nrenv::restore()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Installing Java JDK\n\nComputational requirements:\nTo follow the workshop, you should have the following programs installed on your machine.
